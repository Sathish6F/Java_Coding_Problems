The DOM API provides the classes to read and write an XML file. 
We can create, delete, modify, and rearrange the node using the DOM API. 
DOM parser parses the entire XML file and creates a DOM object in the memory. 
It models an XML file in a tree structure for easy traversal and manipulation. 
In DOM everything in an XML file is a node. The node represents a component of an 
XML file. DOM parser is slow in process and occupies lots of memory when it loads an 
XML file into memory.
